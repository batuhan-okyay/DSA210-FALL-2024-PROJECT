This project aims to analyze my personal activity data from YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, and
League of Legends (LoL) to gain insights into my entertainment habits across different
platforms. By examining the data, I aim to uncover patterns, trends, and preferences in my
video, music, gaming, and streaming service consumption.

I downloaded the data from each platform. The data formats varied, so I converted them into
a standardized format for easier processing (pending). For instance, I converted raw data into Pandas
data frames, applying preprocessing techniques such as timestamp conversion, text
normalization, and user-specific anonymization (e.g., removing potentially sensitive
information about other players in League of Legends)(pending). Additionally, I performed initial
cleaning to handle missing values, remove irrelevant data, and create new features like
session duration or content genre tags (pending).

After preparing the data, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and
trends (pending).
First I examined the time I spent on each platform per month and year and
visualized these patterns using a line plot (pending). I assume that this analysis will reveal
clear shifts in my consumption habits, such as a decline in Netflix usage during summer and
a spike in YouTube activity during the exam period.
I also calculated the time of day I use each platform (morning, afternoon, evening, night) and
visualized this with a bar chart (pending). Probably, the results will show a strong preference
for gaming on League of Legends during late evenings, while music listening on Spotify was
more evenly distributed throughout the day.

For League of Legends data, I extracted additional insights, such as the frequency of games
played by the champion, role (e.g., support, mid-laner), and outcomes (win/loss). I visualized
the win rates for each role using a horizontal bar chart (pending). As a potential result, my
win rate as a jungler will be significantly higher than in other roles, suggesting it might be my
most effective playstyle.

I analyzed my Netflix data to uncover genre preferences by calculating the proportion of time
spent on each genre. This is visualized as a pie chart (pending). Additionally, I tracked my
average session duration over time to see if binge-watching behavior was decreasing or
increasing (pending).

For Spotify, I examined my top artists and genres, as well as seasonal patterns in listening
habits (pending). For instance, I expect to find a noticeable shift toward genres like dance/electronic
and techno house during the summer months, while upbeat hip-pop tracks peaked in the
winter. A word cloud of frequently played artists was also generated to provide a
visual summary (pending).

I analyzed my YouTube data by visualizing activity patterns using histograms (pending). I
created a histogram to examine viewing activity by time of day. I explored the distribution
of watch time across video categories and the length of videos watched (pending).

To gain deeper insights, I explored correlations between my platform usage (pending). For instance,
I checked whether long Netflix sessions coincided with reduced gaming activity on League
of Legends and visualize this relationship using a scatter plot (pending).
This comprehensive analysis will probably provide valuable insights into my entertainment habits,
helping me better understand and potentially optimize my time across platforms.
