The aim of this project is to analyze my personal activity data from YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, and League of Legends (LoL) to gain insights into my entertainment habits across different platforms. By examining my data, I aim to uncover patterns, trends, and preferences in my consumption of video, music, gaming, and streaming services.

The project utilizes advanced data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization techniques, and hypothesis testing to derive actionable insights. A small machine learning component is also integrated to predict future behaviors based on past data.
