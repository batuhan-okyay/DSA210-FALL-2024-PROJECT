# DSA210-Fall2024-Project_Description

This project aims to analyze my personal activity data from YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix to gain insights into my entertainment habits across different platforms. By examining the data, I aim to uncover patterns, trends, and preferences in my video, music, and streaming service consumption.

I downloaded the data from each platform. The data formats varied, so I converted them into a standardized format for easier processing. For instance, I converted raw data into Pandas data frames, applying preprocessing techniques such as timestamp conversion, text normalization, and user-specific anonymization. Additionally, I performed initial cleaning to handle missing values, remove irrelevant data, and create new features like session duration or content genre tags.

After preparing the data, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends. First I examined the time I spent on each platform per month and year and visualized these patterns using a line plot. I assume that this analysis will reveal clear shifts in my consumption habits, such as a decline in Netflix usage during summer and a spike in YouTube activity during the exam period. I also calculated the time of day I use each platform (morning, afternoon, evening, night) and visualized this with a bar chart. Also I used different types of visualizations such as heatmap, tables for relations of spending time as Youtube, Spotify and Netflix. Probably, the results will show a strong preference for watchking movies on Netflix during late evenings, while music listening on Spotify was more evenly distributed throughout the day.

I analyzed my Netflix data to uncover genre preferences by calculating the proportion of time spent on each genre. This is visualized as a pie chart (pending). Additionally, I tracked my average session duration over time to see if binge-watching behavior was decreasing or increasing.

For Spotify, I examined my top artists and genres, as well as seasonal patterns in listening habits. For instance, I expect to find a noticeable shift toward genres like dance/electronic and techno house during the summer months, while upbeat hip-pop tracks peaked in the winter. A word cloud of frequently played artists was also generated to provide a visual summary.

I analyzed my YouTube data by visualizing activity patterns using histograms. I created a histogram to examine viewing activity by time of day. I explored the distribution of watch time across video categories and the length of videos watched .

To gain deeper insights, I explored correlations between my platform usage. For instance, I checked whether long Netflix sessions coincided with reduced learnings from Youtube and visualize this relationship using a scatter plot. This comprehensive analysis will probably provide valuable insights into my entertainment habits, helping me better understand and potentially optimize my time across platforms.

To estimate future usage trends on each platform, predictive modeling job should be included. I will forecast monthly consumption hours and genre preferences for upcoming year using historical data and machine learning approaches like regression models and time series analysis. To guarantee correctness, that activity will entail training and assessing models using measures like RMSE or MAE. Knowledge gained from that predictive study will help me look forward at my entertainment preferences.
